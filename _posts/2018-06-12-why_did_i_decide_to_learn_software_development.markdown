Every spring, each student enrolled in Heat Transfer is tasked with a seemingly impossible assignment over spring break. While the rest of the students are getting tan on the beaches of Punta Cana or Miami, the engineering students are getting more and more ghostly in the basement of the engineering building. They are pushed to their limits to write a MatLab program to determine the temperature of an oddly shaped wall, subject to different weather patterns, after a certain amount of time has passed. I took Heat Transfer 5 years ago and this assignment was the first true test of my coding abilities.

As a student athlete I was not able to participate in the late nights in the lab with the rest of my class mates. I had two-a-days, away games and mandatory team bonding. Every free minute I had was spent with a laptop in my hand, integrating, iterating, testing, and running my code. Returning back to campus on that Monday morning and heading into class, I felt defeated. I had failed for sure. I had written something for Part A (60 pts), but I was not confident. I didn’t even get to Parts B-D (total of 15pts), which were simple questions based on the solution for Part A. I’d hoped the professor would at least feel bad for me and give me partial credit. Looking around at my other classmates, I knew I was not alone in feeling that way. I looked to my friend Tarah across the room, and shook my head in defeat.

The professor went around the lab, running each student’s code and scrutinized their solution based on the input he put in. The first few students’ results were riddled with error messages, and could not even produce a Temperature. This was pure entertaining for my professor. He loved that his assignment was difficult. He watched the remaining students tense in their seats. A few of the next students managed to generate a temperature, but they were off by about 20-30 degrees. All I remember was thinking, let’s get this over with so I can take a nap…

When the professor got to me, I already felt defeated by the project and had given up hope that I could pass. It was clear that the professor took satisfaction in the fear of this project and the disappointment in the wrong answers. When he went through my code, he first scolded me for leaving out a section that was for additional brownie points but then he very reluctantly told me that my answer was correct. I tried to keep it cool, but in my head I felt extremely satisfied. The gratification of the right answer was immediate and I have been waiting for this feeling to come over me again. Each time I run code, the feeling rushes back and I feel fulfilled by each successful function.
